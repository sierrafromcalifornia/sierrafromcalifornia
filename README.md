### Hi, I'm Sierra. ðŸ‘‹

My career has spanned deep tech, social impact, and growth hacking for organizations who's work I want to further. When not working, I'm likely out exploring and connecting more dots every day as I meet people and discover more about the communities around me. I care deeply about the intersection of tech and the human condition on a global scale and dope art in the variety of forms that may come.
